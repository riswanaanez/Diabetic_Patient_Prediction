# **Diabetes Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning** 

This Python project implements supervised machine learning algorithms to Predict Diabetes in Patients. The classification models used include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## **Libraries**

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. scikit-learn (sklearn)
   
## **Project Overview**

The project follows these key steps:

1. Data Setup: Importing datasets and essential libraries.
2. Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values and outliers.
3. Data Partitioning: Splitting the dataset into input and output features.
4. Train-Test Split: Dividing the data for accurate model evaluation.
5. Data Normalization: Normalizing data using standard scaler normalization.
6. Model Creation: Implementing KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM classifiers.
7. Performance Evaluation: Assessing model performance using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and classification reports.

## **Insights**

All three models show good predictive performance. However, KNN achieves the highest accuracy of 0.796 among the implemented models.
