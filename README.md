# **Diabetes Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning** 

This Python project implements supervised machine learning algorithms to Predict Diabetes in Patients. The classification models used include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). This project focuses on accurately classifying individuals based on their health data.

## **Overview**

The diabetic patients' dataset used in this project contains information about various health metrics and patient characteristics. It is commonly used for predictive modeling tasks in healthcare and medical research.

## **Libraries**

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. scikit-learn (sklearn)
   
## **Workflow**

The project follows these key steps:

1. Data Setup: Importing datasets and essential libraries.
2. Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values and outliers.
3. Data Partitioning: Splitting the dataset into input and output features.
4. Train-Test Split: Dividing the data for accurate model evaluation.
5. Data Normalization: Normalizing data using standard scaler normalization.
6. Model Creation: Implementing KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM classifiers.
7. Performance Evaluation: Assessing model performance using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and classification reports.

## **Insights**

Upon evaluating the models, it is observed that all three algorithms demonstrate good predictive capabilities. However, KNN stands out with the highest accuracy of 0.796. This insight provides valuable information for healthcare practitioners, indicating that KNN may be a suitable choice for diabetes prediction based on the dataset and features considered in this project.
